# Housing_Price_Prediction
In this project, I employed feature selection methods to identify the most relevant numeric and categorical features affecting housing prices, and then applied them to a linear regression model. While the model's performance ranks at only 50% compared to other Kaggle competitors, it remains highly interpretable.
